# HolidayProject2018
Scrape a website to find changes over time

**You need to create a file named "variables.py" that contains your Twilio account SID (named "account_sid"), your authentication token (named "auth_token"), and your Twilio phone numer (named "twilio_phone_number").**

githoliday_ultraminimal.py is the optimal, reduced, refactored code (that only checks for changes). 
githoliday_final_stable.py has more functions but is larger and worse.

The ultraminimal version of this code is my primary code, the best version, and the most efficient. It scrapes a website on an interval and texts you with Twilio if the site has changed. 

index.html (a GitHub pages site) is merely for testing. It contains the assignment instructions for this project.
